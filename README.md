# Turpal - Backend Developer Technical Challenae

## ðŸ“– Context

Welcome to your technical take-home challenge!

Imagine you're joining a travel company called **Travello** as a backend developer. The platform originally sold curated experiences (tours, events, etc.) directly. As the company has grown, it now faces increased load and the need to integrate with multiple third-party providers. It also needs to refactor parts of its codebase to support future scalability.

You're inheriting a **legacy Laravel codebase**. It's messy in parts, shows signs of tight coupling and missing abstractions, and has some performance issues â€” the typical realities of a fast-moving startup.

## ðŸš€ Challenge Scope

### ðŸ”Œ Integrate One Third-Party Provider

You are asked to integrate one of these fictional third-party providers:

- [Heavenly Tours API Docs](https://mock.turpal.com/docs/heavenly)
- [Majesty Travels API Docs](https://mock.turpal.com/docs/majesty)

The idea is to implement a clean and extensible integration with one of these providers, keeping in mind the growing number of future providers. By "transparent," we mean keeping the provider logic encapsulated, while preserving the internal data structure of our own platform.

Your responsibilities:

- Ensure integration is clean and **transparent**
- Normalize responses from different providers into a **unified format**
- Design your solution to be extensible for future provider integrations without significant rewrites

### ðŸ“¡ Topics for the Follow-Up Interview

The following topics are outside the scope of the take-home assignment, but we may explore them during the follow-up discussion to better understand your thinking and approach:

- Challenges you encountered during the provider integration
- Refactoring strategies and performance considerations
- Ideas for improving the internal API design
- Designing an online booking flow
- Adapting the system for future needs such as:
  - E-commerce capabilities
  - Multi-tenancy
  - Localization and multi-language support
  - Multi-currency handling
